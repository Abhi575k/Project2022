In this week, the mentees were taught various searching and sorting algorithms and were asked to implement some of them. Topics such as binary search were covered in detail beyond the trivial use of searching an element in a sorted list. Furthermore, topics such as Binary Exponentiation and modular arithmetic were covered. A mashup contest based on the above concepts was also organised.

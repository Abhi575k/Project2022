# **Summary of Git and Github**

## 1.Git
Git is a version control system for tracking changes to projects , who made the changes and for coding collaboration.

### **Uses of Git** 

- Manage projects with Repositories
- Clone a project to work on a local copy
- Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
- Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
- Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
- Push local updates to the main project

### Working with Git
- Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
- Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
- When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
- You select the modified files you want to Stage
- The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
- Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
- You can revert back to any previous commit.
- Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!

## 2. Github
GitHub is an online hosting service for Git repositories. Imagine working on a project at home and while you are away, maybe at a friend's place, you suddenly remember the solution to a code error that has kept you restless for days.

You cannot make these changes because your PC is not with you. But if you have your project hosted on GitHub, you can access and download that project with a command on whatever computer you have access to. Then you can make your changes and push the latest version back to GitHub.

In summary, GitHub lets you store your repo on their platform. Another awesome feature that comes with GitHub is the ability to collaborate with other developers from any location.

Now that we have created and initialized our project locally, let's push it to GitHub.

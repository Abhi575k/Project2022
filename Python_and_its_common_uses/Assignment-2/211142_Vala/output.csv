Devendra Mani (dmani[AT]iitk.ac.in)  PhD (IISc Bangalore) Phone: 0512-259-2160 (O) Research Interests: Macroscopic properties of materials are a manifestation of interactions among the constituting individual molecules. Spectroscopic studies on intermolecular clusters provide means to explore various intermolecular interactions and molecular dynamics. Our group is interested in studying intermolecular clusters and understanding bulk phenomena, such as chemical reactions, crystallization, and solvation from a molecular point of view. For this purpose, we plan to use a helium nanodroplet isolation machine coupled with a high-resolution infrared laser. The helium nanodroplets are clusters of several thousand helium atoms that have an equilibrium temperature of 0.4 kelvin and are superfluid in nature. Superfluid helium nanodroplets have proven to be an ideal medium to isolate individual molecules, and form intermolecular clusters. Moreover, helium nanodroplets are ideal nanoreactors to study chemical reactions at a microscopic level. Studying chemical reactions in helium nanodroplets will help us gain insights into chemical processes that take place in the interstellar space, where there is hardly any thermal energy available as temperatures are of the order of only a few Kelvin! We will also use electronic structure calculations to complement our experimental findings.

The key tools I employ to understand these processes include mostly experimental rock deformations under elevated pressure-temperature conditions and field investigations, coupled with analytical and numerical modelling.

Jonaki Sen (jonaki[AT]iitk.ac.in)  PhD (A.E. College of Medicine, New York)  Phone: 0512-259-4054 (O) Research Interests: Vertebrate neuronal development Our goal is to understand the molecular mechanism of how neurons are generated, undergo migration, differentiate and make connections with their appropriate targets. We aim to identify the molecules that regulate these processes in the visual system, the cortex and the hippocampus, using the developing chick and mouse as model systems.

Nitin Gupta  (guptan[AT]iitk.ac.in) PhD (University of California San Diego) Phone: 0512-259-4384 (O) Research Interests: The remarkable capabilities organized by the brain from seeing to singing, from remembering to running - originate in the electrical activities of neurons. Neurons interact with each other forming circuits, which process sensory information and drive appropriate behaviors. We are interested in understanding the fundamental mechanisms used by neural circuits for processing information. Our initial focus is on circuits in deeper layers of the olfactory system (sense of smell). We use a variety of insects as model systems, including grasshoppers, flies and mosquitoes, and a variety of techniques, including in vivo electrophysiology, histology, behavioral observations, genetic manipulations, and computational modeling.

Asima Pradhan (asima[AT]iitk.ac.in) PhD (City University of New York) Phone: 0512-259-7691 / 7971 (O) Research Interests: My research interests have been in the area of Biophotonics, attempting to understand tissue fluorescence and light scattering in human tissue environment and to evaluate its use for diagnosis of disease. Recent focus lies in the areas of Fluorescence Mueller matrix imaging and spectroscopy, attenuation free fluorescence based diagnostics which include development of automated device for clinical use, development of fluorescence and photoacoustic diffuse optical tomographic reconstruction algorithms, frequency domain tomography for tissue diagnosis and fluorescence lifetime imaging in the ultrafast regime. Future interests are to explore ways to improve such diagnostic capabilities in order take it towards the desired goal of noninvasive and early detection of disease, specifically cancer.

# Task

This week task is pretty simple :)

 1. You have to implement a C++/Python program where I give `private key (n, d, 32-bit)` as input and it must print `public key (e ,n)`. You are not allowed to use any library except I/O and maths. Ref: [GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/ "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/")  
 2. Implement RSA encryption in Python (You can use a library like Crypto). I will input a private key and mssg, it should print public key and encrypted mssg  

Get your files ready by next **Jun 18, 2022**. Submission method will be provided later.

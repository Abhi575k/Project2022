# Welcome to BlockChain101

## Intro

A blockchain is a distributed, peer-to-peer database that hosts a continuously growing number of transactions. Each transaction in a “block,” is secured through cryptography, timestamped, and validated by every authorized member of the database using consensus algorithms (i.e., a set of rules). Rather than the centralized “Hub and Spoke” type of network, Blockchain is a decentralized peer to peer network. Where each NODE has a copy of the ledger.

## Programming Assignments

These theoretical components will be supplemented by Programming assignments which would include implementation of some core features of a Blockchain like implementing Hashing Algorithm and Mining Blocks, Consensus Protocol , Public-Private Key Encryption and decryption and many more.
